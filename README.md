# Job-Bot

Current Functionality
- Integration with USAJobs where:
   - Users can search for jobs by keyword, location, positiontitle, organization, min & max salary
 
- The general syntax for the bot is:
   - |search [Keyword]
   - With flags such as:
        - -o for Organization & Agency Code searching
        - -p for PositionTitle
        - -l for Location
        - -min for mininum salary
        - -max for maximum salary

Use Case:
- The general use case for this bot is so that members of the club that I run which is called Stockton's Cybersecurity Warriors will have a bot that allows them to search for jobs from within discord.

Planned Features:
- Add other API's of other organizations to it.
	- Make it so there's a an identifier that tells of the the organization or have a filter that makes it so the user can search by API. So for example they can search by usajobs, spirit, or others

- Moderation
	- Maybe add functionalities that Carl-bot and others may typically use.
		- Have to look at our Carl-Bot Does their code though.
- Host notes maybe?
	- Host a Collaborated Obisidian wiki?
- Add a custom news part, so we don't have to rely on the Cybersecurity News bot.
